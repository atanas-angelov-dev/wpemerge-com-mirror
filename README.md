# What is this?

This is a mirror of the first released version of [https://wpemerge.com/](https://wpemerge.com/) to serve as an example of WP Emerge in the wild.

There are plans for a tutorial series which will be about creating a site from scratch which will be a much better example of how to use WP Emerge.

# Dirty laundry disclosure

- The theme is simple - it does not use most of the advanced features of WP Emerge like Routes, Controllers, Middleware etc.
- The code is far from perfect.
- A lof of the home template is hardcoded.
- A lof of the home template is not translatable.
- There are some images that are referenced by their hardcoded attachment id which is usually a no-no.
